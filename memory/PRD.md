# Concrete Form — Product Requirements

## Overview
A mobile-first React Native (Expo) field-ops app for concrete/ICF contractors. Engineered for foremen and crews wearing gloves: large tap targets, high-contrast Swiss design, monospace numerics, safety-orange accents.

## Stack
- **Frontend:** Expo Router, React Native (Expo SDK 54), TypeScript
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Motor + MongoDB
- **Auth:** JWT (access + refresh) with bcrypt, RBAC (admin/foreman/crew)
- **AI:** None on mobile (Quote Analyzer/Leads/Quick Estimator deferred per user)
- **PDF:** Client-side HTML → PDF via expo-print + expo-sharing
- **Push:** Emergent managed push (inert until native build + google-services.json supplied)

## Modules implemented
1. **Auth** — Login + silent refresh + seeded admin. Account lockout after 5 failures.
2. **Dashboard** — Utilization %, active rentals, upcoming returns ≤7d, open maintenance, quick actions, recent activity.
3. **Bracing Engine** — Multiple wall runs; 1 strongback/corner + 1 brace per 4 ft of wall (ceil). Brace length by height: ≤10′→10′, 10–12′→12′, 12–16′→16′, 16–20′→20′; >20′ flags engineer required. Outputs totals, per-run breakdown, braces-by-length order list.
4. **Construction Calculator** — 6 sub-tabs: ICF Wall Concrete, Ft-In ↔ Decimal, Area, ICF Blocks (presets: Standard/NUDURA/Fox/Amvic/BuildBlock/Custom), Rebar Takeoff (#3–#8), Dimension Math (running tape with scale ×/÷).
5. **Equipment Inventory** — SKUs with 6 categories (strongback, turnbuckle, walkboard bracket, hand rail, TB extension, crankup scaffold). CRUD + CSV import/export.
6. **Rentals** — Multi-SKU rentals, customer info, deposits, partial returns, HTML→PDF Delivery Ticket via share sheet. Auto-decrements equipment availability.
7. **Bookings & Capacity** — Tentative/confirmed pipeline + per-date capacity checker across all equipment.
8. **Maintenance** — Service log linked to equipment with status (open/in_progress/resolved) + cost.
9. **Vendors** — ICF block supplier directory with categories, freight terms, truck capacity, lead time. Tap to call/email.
10. **Site Admin** — Brand name, tagline, logo upload (base64), company contact for delivery tickets.
